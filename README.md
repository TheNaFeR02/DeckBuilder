# Deckbuilder
This is an app created to organize your builds for the minigame Cybertitans. 

# Project Motivation
Often times since I started to work with frontend a couple of years ago, I was continuously told and encouraged to use typescript right away ("because it's better"), skipping the learning curve of javascript and not appreciating in reality the necessity of typescript. With this project I think I got a real grasp of why using typescript is really good when the codebase becomes larger and larger and also the easier integration between modules that type checking gets you, among other things.

The purpose of the project was to enhanced my javascript skills. If you don't know what's the game about, don't worry me neither. It was built as an exercise with a friend doing as project manager asking for different requirements that he would like to have. The idea was to have a chat about the requirements with him and I was trying to get to know what he wants and reproduce it.
